# Vision

## Why We Exist

Interactive fiction should be accessible to writers, not just programmers. Collaborative storytelling should enable creativity, not drown it in merge conflicts and technical barriers.

We exist to prove that writers can create complex, branching narratives together using simple tools and powerful automation.

## The Problem We're Solving

**For aspiring interactive fiction authors:**
- Traditional IF tools require programming knowledge, local development environments, and technical expertise
- Collaboration on branching narratives is fragile - one person's changes can break another's story paths
- Testing all possible paths manually is impossible beyond trivial stories
- Publishing requires build pipelines, hosting, and deployment knowledge

**For collaborative writing teams:**
- Git workflows are intimidating for non-technical writers
- Continuity errors multiply exponentially with branching narratives
- No easy way to visualize or audit the complete story structure
- Friction between "writing" and "shipping" kills momentum

## Who We Serve

**Primary:** Writers participating in NaNoWriMo who want to explore interactive fiction without becoming software developers

**Secondary:** Small collaborative writing teams who value:
- Daily writing practice and accountability
- Immediate feedback and publication
- Quality through automation rather than gatekeeping
- Creative experimentation with branching narratives

## What Success Looks Like

**Short-term (NaNoWriMo 2025):**
- Complete a 50,000+ word interactive fiction story collaboratively
- Authors contribute daily using only GitHub's web interface
- Zero continuity errors across all story paths at publication
- Changes go live in under 2 minutes from commit to web

**Long-term:**
- Writers choose our workflow because it's simpler than traditional IF tools
- Teams cite our approach as the model for collaborative IF development
- The question "how do you ensure continuity in branching narratives?" has an automated answer
- Non-programmers confidently publish complex interactive fiction

## Our Unique Approach

We combine:
1. **Zero-barrier contribution** - Edit in a web browser, no installation required
2. **Exhaustive automated testing** - AI validates every possible story path
3. **Multiple perspectives** - Same content, different formats for different needs (play, proofread, visualize, audit)
4. **Transparent automation** - Writers see exactly what's being checked and why

We're not building a writing tool. We're removing every obstacle between a writer's imagination and a published interactive story.

## Strategic North Star

When making decisions, ask:
- Does this make it easier for a writer to contribute their first passage?
- Does this increase confidence that the story maintains internal consistency?
- Does this reduce the time between "I have an idea" and "readers can experience it"?
- Does this empower writers to focus on storytelling rather than tooling?

If the answer is yes, we're on the right path.
