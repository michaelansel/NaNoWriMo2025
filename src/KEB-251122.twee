:: Day 22 KEB

The next morning, Javlyn woke to find the blue creature curled up at the foot of her bed, snoring softly. In the daylight streaming through her window, she could see its scales had a faint iridescent quality, shifting between blue and green depending on the angle.

She carefully got out of bed, trying not to disturb it, and started preparing breakfast. The events of yesterday felt surreal - the monster attack, the travelers, the way the creature had fought so fiercely. And now it was just... sleeping in her cottage like it belonged there.

"Morning!" the creature chirped, suddenly appearing in the doorway. It moved so quietly for something with claws.

"Good morning," Javlyn replied, pulling out some dried meat she'd bought from the butcher after the incident. "I saved this for you."

The creature's eyes lit up and it bounded over, accepting the offering with what could only be described as a happy purr. As it ate, Javlyn couldn't help but smile. Whatever this creature was, it seemed to have decided she was its person now.

There was a knock at the door. Through the window, she could see it was Terence, one of the travelers from yesterday.

"Stay here," she told the creature, who tilted its head but remained in place.

When she opened the door, Terence gave a polite nod. "Morning. I wanted to apologize if we made you uncomfortable yesterday. We were just... surprised. Never seen anything like your friend before."

"That makes two of us," Javlyn admitted. "I only met it the day before yesterday."

"Really?" Terence looked genuinely surprised. "The way it defended you, I assumed you'd been together for years. That's remarkable." He paused. "We're heading out today, but I wanted to give you this before we left."

He handed her a small leather-bound journal. "It's blank, but I thought you might want to record your experiences with the creature. If it's truly something new to this world, your observations could be valuable. To you, if nothing else."

Javlyn accepted the journal, touched by the gesture. "Thank you. That's very kind."

After Terence left, she sat down at her table with the journal open before her. The creature hopped up onto the chair beside her, peering curiously at the blank pages.

"Well," Javlyn said, picking up her pen, "I suppose we should start at the beginning. How I found you in the rain..."
